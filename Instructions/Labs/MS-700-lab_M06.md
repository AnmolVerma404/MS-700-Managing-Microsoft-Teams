# **Lab 06: - Manage communication in Microsoft Teams**

# **Student lab manual**

## **Microsoft 365 user interface**

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you may experience user interface (UI) changes that were made following the development of this training content. This will manifest itself in UI changes that do not match up with the detailed instructions presented in this lab manual.

The Microsoft World-Wide Learning team will update this training course as soon as any such changes are brought to our attention. However, given the dynamic nature of cloud updates, you may run into UI changes before this training content is updated. **If this occurs, you will have to adapt to the changes and work through them in the lab exercises as needed.**

## **Lab Scenario**

In the labs of this course you will assume the role of Joni Sherman, a Teams Administrator for Contoso Ltd. and her pilot team that shall evaluate the capabilities of Microsoft Teams in a testing environment. According to Contoso business requirements, Microsoft Teams will be used as an organization’s solution for conferencing and telephony. Therefore, Teams admins need to configure conferencing functionalities, such as meetings and live event features that will provide best user experience during collaboration and communication. Furthermore, Teams admins will need to replace Contoso legacy PBX solution and configure voice features that will provide users with Teams calling capabilities.

## **Objectives**

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

- Manage meeting policies

- Configure meeting settings

- Create live event policies

- Create a live event

- Configure emergency addresses

- Create calling policies

- Configure resource accounts and calling queues

- Create resource accounts and auto attendants

- Test configured meeting policies

- Test configured meeting settings

- Set up a Calling Plan

- Order and Assign phone numbers

## **Lab Setup**

- **Estimated Time:** 90 minutes.

## **Instructions**

### **Exercise 1: Manage Live event and meetings experiences**

Contoso organization has deployed Microsoft 365 and is testing pilot projects on collaboration and communication scenarios to meet business requirements. First, Teams admins need to configure meeting policies and schedule initial meetings. Then, business managers want to test the Live meetings option in Microsoft Teams in order to broadcast audio and video to large audiences.

#### Task 1 - Edit the default meeting policy and restrict all recording features for meetings

As part of your pilot project for setting up the events and meetings in your organization, you need to fulfil the requirement for all meetings in teams, including prohibiting meeting recording. You will edit the default meeting policy to ensure that this requirement is met.

1. Connect to the **Client 1 VM** and sign in with the Credentials that have been provided to you.

2. In Microsoft Edge, sign in to **Microsoft Teams admin center** ([https://admin.teams.microsoft.com](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com)) as user **Joni Sherman** (JoniS@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com).

3. In the **Teams admin center,** under **Meetings** section, choose **Meeting policies**.

4. Edit the **Global (Org-wide default)** policy review the available settings, and turn **Off** the **Allow cloud recording** setting.

You have successfully modified the Global (Org-wide default) meeting policy and disabled the recording functionality for meetings. It will take some time for the changes to be applied to the users, so you will continue with the next task and test the configured settings at the end of this lab.

#### Task 2 – Test the meeting policy for restricting recording

In this task you need to sign in to the second client and create a meeting with a user. You will see how the configured policy works and users won’t be able to record a meeting.

1. Open the **Microsoft Teams Desktop client**, where you are already signed in as **Megan Bowen** (MeganB@&lt;YourTenant&gt;.onmicrosoft.com).
